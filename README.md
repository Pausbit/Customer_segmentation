1. **Data:** This directory contains the datasets used in the analysis.
2. **Notebooks:**
   - `1_data_preparation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing.
   - `2_eda.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis.
   - `3_feature_engineering.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for feature engineering.
   - `4_modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for KMeans clustering and PCA.
   - `5_visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for visualizing the results.
3. **Scripts:**
   - `utils.py`: Python script containing utility functions used in the analysis.
4. **Results:** This directory contains the output files and visualizations generated during the analysis.
5. **README.md**: Documentation providing an overview of the repository and its contents.
